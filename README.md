# Guidelines so I may surveil myself and be more consistent

## Naming and planning is certainly, for me at least, the most challenging task

---

## Organizing classes in Angular, in this order

1. Variable declarations;
2. Constructor and Hooks;
3. Functions instantiated by the hooks;
4. Event Triggered Functions;
5. Helper functions (any of the above);

## Naming

### Case

1. Classes are PascalCase, though its instances are camelCase;
2. Functions and variables are camelCase;
3. Constants and mocks are SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE;

### Choosing a name

1. Variables and classes are nouns;
2. Functions are verbs;
3. Event Triggered Functions begin with 'on';
4. Event Emitters end with 'Event';
5. Booleans are questions 'isSelected, hasChanged...';
